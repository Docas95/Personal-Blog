# Personal Blog

For my first 'big' project, I decided to make a personal blog for myself. A blog which I will use to document my journey in learning about cybersecurity.

## How does it work?

This blog only allows the blog allows the blog owner to create new posts at any time. These posts can be found at '/archive' where users can click on any post to fully read it.

To delete a post, the blog owner must go to '/archive', there, near the title of every blog posts, is an 'X' which can be used to delete a singular post.

Only the blog owner can create/delete posts.

The blogs allows any user to create an account which they can use to make comments on any post. Users can only delete comments they posted.

## How to use this repository?

To use this repo to make your own blog simply:

- make sure you have the lattest version of python installed

- install the flask library and it's extensions(flask_login, flask_sqlalchemy)

- copy this repo to your own computer

- run the webapp using 'python .\main.py'

Note: I would not recommend using this code to make your own webapp. I am still learning so I am sure people with more knowledge than me have figured out better ways to make blogs. User their code instead.
