    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>
        You can call me Docas. At the time of the creation of this blog I am a 16 year old highschooler and I'll be starting my last year of school in a few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of personality, I am quite a shy and introverted person. Being with people isn't really my thing and I'm not very good at socializing with others, I am the most comfortable when I'm alone or with a small group of close friends. I sometimes find it nice to meet new people, but it's usually a stressing situation. I've been told I have a great sense of humor, I tend to make people laugh with my jokes, wich is something I enjoy a lot, although I wouldn't call myself a comedian or anything like that. I'm pretty creative and love to come up with new ideas about various topics and find new ways to see the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to my interests, I tend to enjoy anything that envolves creativity and problem solving. I love drawing and spend way more time than I would like to admit playing videogames. I also have a great interest in technology, especially cybersecurity. I started learning how to program a few months ago using Harvard's cs50 and I feel like I've finally reached a level where I can call myself a programmer. I'm not super good at coding, but it's something I love doing and, as of right now, I think I'm finally able to use my skills to solve basic problems using code and I can also write basic programs, like simple websites and videogames, with a little help from google. The area of technology that interest me the most is cybersecurity. Ever since I was a kid, I've always enjoyed the idea of being a hacker that is smart enough to hack into any system. As I got older I decided to learn more about the topic, I main used youtube youtubes and spotify podcasts as my teachers and I learned a lot from them. I think cybersecurity is a super important field, I mean in the age of technology what can be more important than making sure that computers and all the data they store are protected at all times? I also really enjoy that it's a field that requires a lot of problem solving skills and constant learning. I'm still young and have a lot to learn, but I can't wait to be able to contribute to this field when I'm older.

    <h3>What is this blog?</h3>
    <p>
        I have always enjoyed technology and a few months ago I decided to take my interest more seriously and decided to learn to code. While doing that I also started listening to tech related podcasts, most of them related to cybersecurity, as that has always been the area of technology that interests me the most.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I think Spotify and Youtube have taught me a lot about the basics of cybersecurity, I would like to deepen my knowledge in it. I created this blog as a way to document everything I learn about related to cybsersec. Besides it being away to keep things organized, I think it'll also serve as motivation to study, since I won't want to leave this blog without any updates for too long.
